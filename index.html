                                Read about Charles Henry Turner, a young boy whose endless questions about insects lead to thoughtful observations, original experiments, and new discoveries—making Turner the first Black entomologist and a pioneer in the field of animal behavior.

                                “A relatively unknown entomologist comes out of oblivion in this engaging picture book biography. Harrington’s text is inviting, and Turner’s enthusiasm comes through clearly...Taylor’s bright, cheerful, expertly rendered cartoon illustrations complement the text. Harrington and Taylor have rescued a worthy scientist from obscurity.”

Clarify that the question has two parts: How questions help us uncover important <i>complexities</i> and how questions help us uncover important <i>connections</i>.<br>Explain that in <i>Buzzing with Questions</i>, Charles Henry Turner is a curious boy consumed with questions about nature. When he can’t find the answers in books, he decides to find the answers himself.

What does “buzzing” describe here? <i>(It describes the questions in Turner’s mind.)</i> What does “buzzing” make you think of? <i>(bees; the sound of bees/insects)</i> Why do you think the author uses the word “buzzing” here? <i>(It compares the questions in Turner’s mind to bees or insects buzzing; it helps readers visualize the vivid description.)</i>* </p>
                    
                    <p><span class="bold">Similes and Metaphors</span> Then explain that the title includes figurative language, or language that goes beyond the literal meaning of the words to create an effect. Two common types of figurative language are similes and metaphors. Similes and metaphors compare two unlike things. Similes use the word <i>like</i> or as to compare, and metaphors compare by suggesting one thing is another thing, without using <i>like</i> or as.

                    <p>Clarify that some details include both figurative and sensory language, as in the phrase “buzzing with questions” from the title, which appeals to the sense of sound. Tell students to watch for examples of sensory language throughout the text and to think about how the language helps them visualize the scene. </p>

                    <h2 id="scrollTop_s3_1">Summary*</h2>
                    <p>Young Charles Henry Turner was fascinated by the natural world, and questions about insects seemed to demand his attention. There were never enough books to answer his questions, and Turner’s teacher finally told him to go find out the answers himself. Turner embraced complexity, and his deep curiosity guided his studies, leading him from high school to college, even though few colleges accepted African American students at the time. At college, Turner connected with an engaging teacher, Clarence L. Herrick, and his fellow biology students. The other students liked “shy, quiet” Turner and recognized his “indefatigable” work habits. Turner constantly researched, conducted experiments, and asked questions. His questions and research led him to first study spiders and their webs, from dusty windowsills inside, to logs and grassy meadows outside, and anywhere else he could observe them.</p>

                    <p>Before sharing this first part of the video about Turner, preview with students the meaning of the terms <i>ecology</i>, <i>neuroscience</i> and <i>stimuli</i>. Prior to viewing, tell students to listen for and list three of Turner’s degrees and/or other scholarly achievements. Then discuss the following questions.</p>

                   <p><span class="bold">Ask:</span> What were some of Turner’s achievements? <i>(He was first in his high school class; earned his Bachelor’s, Master’s, and PhD; and published many scholarly papers in respected science journals.) How did prejudice impact his life? (He couldn’t get a professorship, which limited his resources, equipment, and staff.) How might prejudice impact scientific advancements in general? (Prejudice limits advancements in science and other fields because it restricts some people with valuable contributions from fully participating.)</i> </p>

                     
                    <h2 id="scrollTop_s3_1">Mirrors & Windows</h2>
                    <p>Have students share their thoughts about how Turner’s questions and curiosity help him connect with nature and with other scientists. Use the questions below to help students explore the topic.  </p>
                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>In what ways did Turner’s questions help him embrace and uncover complexities in nature? <i>(He realized that not all questions about the natural world have answers in books; often scientists must “go and find out.” His detailed observations helped him find things other scientists may have dismissed or overlooked.) </i></li>
                        <li>How did Turner’s questions help him connect with other scientists in important ways? <i>(Despite racial prejudice, Turner was accepted into college and formed close friendships with his white teacher and fellow biology students. The other students “liked the shy, quiet student who always earned high grades.” (p. 9) In the biology class, the students seemed to focus on what they had in common rather than on external differences.)</i></li>
                       <li>How might studying nature help people realize how much they have in common with others? <i>(Studying nature gives us perspective. When we study differences among plants and different animal species, we realize that physical differences among people are only superficial. Biologically, we are more alike than different.)</i></li>
                       <li>When has a shared interest or curiosity led you to connect with someone who seemed very different from you? Explain.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="scrollTop_s3_1">Summary</h2>
                    <p>Turner questioned whether spiders were “weaving machines” that made the same web over and over, or whether they could learn and adapt. He conducted detailed observations and experiments, altering spiders’ environments repeatedly and observing how they adapted their webs as a result. He concluded that spiders were complex creatures capable of “intelligent action.” His questions led him to discover a new type of crustacean and later to focus on how ants could find their way home. Turner eventually found work as a biology teacher at Sumner High School, but he never stopped asking questions and always tried to learn more about the natural world. He turned his attention to studying bees in a local park and inspired his biology students with his experiments. He became the first scientist to prove that bees could see color. His questions continued to guide him, leading to new discoveries about moths, ant-lions, caterpillars, and cockroaches, among other insects. </p>

                    <p><span class="bold">Ask:</span> In what ways does the research at Johns Hopkins build on the ideas in Turner’s research? <i>(It builds on the idea that spiders use their brains to make webs. The Johns Hopkins scientists are studying which brain mechanisms are responsible for the behaviors used to build webs.) </i> How does their research, like Turner’s, show the importance of understanding connections among living things? <i>(The scientists want to apply this knowledge about spiders to learn how human brains implement complex behaviors.)</i></p>

I felt like I had a darkness growing inside me too. It made me feel angry and mean, and I took it out on the people I loved most.” (p. 206) </li>

                                        <li>Turner’s questions about nature eventually led to his career as a biology teacher. How was Turner able to connect with his biology students at Sumner High School? <i>(He inspired and excited his students by sharing his own research and experiments; he showed what it was possible to achieve despite racial prejudice of the time.)</i></li>
                                        <li>At Sumner, Turner helped his students study complex questions and discover new ideas about the natural world. Tell about a time when a teacher or mentor encouraged you to keep working on a complex subject, activity, or other interest, despite its difficulty. </li>
                                        <li>What role do teachers play in guiding and connecting us—beyond school? <i>(Student responses will vary, but they may recognize that teachers who believe in them help empower them to work hard and do difficult, but important, things.

                    <p>Throughout his life, Turner never stopped asking hard questions, making observations, or conducting experiments. His questions led to groundbreaking discoveries in animal behavior, and he became an internationally recognized entomologist, publishing more than fifty scientific papers in his lifetime. Despite his scientific achievements, Turner faced racial prejudice and lived through racial violence, such as the East St. Louis Race Riot. While in St. Louis, Turner worked with Black and White people in his community to make the city a better place. He shared his curiosity with his students at Sumner High School, he was always willing to help other scientists, and he led a settlement house to raise money for the poor. According to Turner, biology could help people see connections among all living things and help them focus on others. Biology sparked Turner’s questions, compelled him to search for answers—however complex they may be, and gave him hope.</p>

                        <li>Turner is a teacher and “devoted scholar who taught students to look closely, to find the webs that connect us all.” (p. 40) Turner felt biology helped people see connections, and it gave him hope. Discuss a time when learning about something complex gave you hope, and explain why.</li>
                        <li>Turner felt that biology “could help people see the connections among all living things.” (35) How might learning or uncovering connections in science help us uncover important connections in other areas of our life? <i>(Possible response: Understanding connections among living things, such as insects and people, might help us realize that the physical differences among people, such as skin color, are only superficial; we are more alike than different.

                                    When Charles Henry Turner was young, his head “buzzed” with endless questions about the insects around him: <i>How do ants find their way home? Can bees see color? Are insects capable of learning?</i> When his teacher told him to “go and find out,” Turner did just that. His questions led him to keep studying and to figure out for himself what he couldn’t find in books.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Turner went to college and later earned his PhD, all while turning his questions into careful observations, creative experiments, and scientific papers. He observed spiders adapting their webs and concluded that they were not just “weaving machines” but were capable of learning. He discovered a new type of crustacean, studied how ants solve problems, and showed that bees sense time and see color.

                                <p>Despite racial prejudice, the “indefatigable” Turner never gave up. His questions led to groundbreaking discoveries in animal behavior, and he became one of the leading scientists of his time. He published more than fifty scientific papers and shared his curiosity and enthusiasm with the high school students he taught in St. Louis. He worked to improve his community and found hope through his studies. He never stopped asking questions.

                                <p>
                                    <span class="bold">Complexity and Curiosity</span> An important theme in <i>Buzzing with Questions</i> is <span class="bold">complexity and curiosity</span>. As Turner’s questions about the natural world become more sophisticated, he struggles to find books that can answer them. Yet, he leans into these complexities, carefully observing the world and creating his own experiments to learn as much as he possibly can.</p>
                                    <p>
                                    <span class="bold">Connections Among All Living Things</span> Another important theme is <span class="bold">connections among all living things</span>. Turner was fascinated by the natural world and insects in particular. The more he observed spiders, ants, bees, and other tiny creatures, the more he recognized that, like humans, they are complex beings, capable of learning and solving problems. At the same time, Turner faced huge barriers due to racial prejudice. Biology gave Turner hope because biology “could help people see the connections among all living things.” (p. 35)

                                </p>
                                <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Sensitivity Issues </h2>

                                <p><span class="bold">Racial Prejudice </span> The text mentions some incidences of racial prejudice from Turner’s time, such as Turner’s teacher worrying about other students’ attitudes toward racial integration. (pp. 8–9) The text also includes discussion of segregation and violence in the South, including discussion and an illustration of the East St. Louis Riot when mobs killed more than 100 African Americans and burned their neighborhoods. (p. 34)
                                </p>
                                <!-- <p><span class="bold">Abandonment</span> Throughout Part 1 especially, Omar thinks his mother may still be alive, and he often searches for her at the market. At times, he feels deep despair wondering if she could have abandoned him and Hassan. (pp. 66–67, 93–94)</p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Mistreatment of People with Disabilities</span> Throughout the text, there are some instances of Hassan and Jeri being bullied due to their disabilities. (pp. 76–80, 102–103, 126–127, 201) In addition, Jeri and Maryam help Omar recognize that he, however well-intentioned, might be underestimating Hassan because of his disability.</p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Arranged Marriage</span> There is discussion of arranged marriage throughout the text. Maryam, Omar’s friend and a top student in their class, must leave school for an arranged marriage. While the topic is sensitive, the nuanced depiction in the text offers insight into the difficult choices refugee families face and the additional barriers to education that threaten girls’ futures.</p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Religious References</span> Throughout the memoir, there are references to God and prayer in the refugee camp. In Chapter 9, there are specific references to the Somali community’s Islamic faith rituals and the celebration of Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr in the camp. </p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Suicide/Despair</span> On p. 138, there is a brief mention of suicide. (“I heard about one guy…his case was rejected by the UN and he couldn’t handle it. He . . . he killed himself.”) Throughout the story, Omar and others face feelings of hopelessness at times.</p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Violence</span> In Chapter 12, Omar recounts the traumatic story of his past, when his father is killed, his home is destroyed, and he and Hassan are separated from their mother. Images include men with guns, burning homes, mounds suggesting graves along the journey, and a hospital scene where Omar and Hassan are very sick. Be especially mindful if any of your students have experienced similar trauma.</p> -->

                            <p>The Inside-Outside Circle activity has students reflect on and discuss their beliefs about how questions help us uncover important complexities and connections. Use this activity as a warm-up for exploring the topic in <i>Buzzing with Questions</i>. </p>
                            <p><span class="bold">1. </span>Arrange students into two equal groups</p>

                            <p><span class="bold">3. </span>The second group forms a circle facing inward and across from a member of the inner circle to make partners (the outside circle).</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">4. </span>Prompt students to answer and discuss a statement from the list.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">5. </span>The inner circle partner goes first, followed by the outer circle partner. Have partners discuss and take notes on their partner’s responses.</p>

                            <p>First, have pairs work together to identify all the examples of figurative language they can find on pp. 4–5.</p>

                            <p>● What is most of the figurative language making a comparison about? If needed, encourage students to look for repeated words. <i>(questions)</i></p>
                           <p>●	How are all the comparisons similar? <i>(They all make comparisons to insects or insect behavior.)</i></p>
                           <p>●	How does the figurative language help you understand Charles Henry Turner’s character? <i>(His questions demand his attention like insects; he can’t stop thinking about them. The figurative language emphasizes his connection to the natural world.)</i></p>
                           <p>●	What is the effect of the figurative and sensory language? <i>(It helps make the descriptions about Turner’s questions more vivid and memorable.)</i></p>

                                    <p>3. For each description, have students tell how the figurative and/or sensory language helps them visualize or understand the text.</p>
                                    <p>4. Finally, have students rewrite one or two descriptions from the text to change them into figurative language. </p>
